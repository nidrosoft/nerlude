# Nerlude Launch - Twitter/X Thread

---

## MAIN LAUNCH THREAD (15 Tweets)

---

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
I just mass-deleted 47 browser tabs.

All open dashboards:
• Vercel
• Supabase
• Stripe
• Cloudflare
• Railway
• Namecheap...

Every founder running multiple products knows this chaos.

So I built something to fix it.

Introducing Nerlude 🚀

🧵👇

---

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
The problem:

Every product you build is glued together by 10-15 services.

Each with its own:
→ Dashboard
→ API keys
→ Billing cycle
→ Renewal date

Now multiply by 3, 5, or 8 products.

That's 50+ potential points of failure.

---

### Tweet 3 (Pain Points)
Real stories from founders I talked to:

❌ Lost a domain because renewal email got buried
❌ $340 surprise bill from a "free tier" forgotten for 6 months
❌ Spent 6 hours hunting API keys to onboard a contractor
❌ No idea what each product actually costs to run

Sound familiar?

---

### Tweet 4 (Why Existing Solutions Fail)
"Just use Notion"
→ Gets stale, no alerts, not secure

"Just use a password manager"
→ No project context, no cost tracking

"Use enterprise tools"
→ $10K+/year, massive overkill

There was nothing built for indie hackers and small teams.

Until now.

---

### Tweet 5 (Introducing Nerlude)
Nerlude is the single source of truth for everything that powers your products.

One dashboard for:
✅ All your services
✅ All your credentials
✅ All your costs
✅ All your renewals
✅ All your team access

Organized by project. Secured properly.

---

### Tweet 6 (Feature: Service Registry)
40+ services pre-configured:

Infrastructure:
→ Vercel, Railway, Netlify, AWS

Databases:
→ Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, MongoDB

Payments:
→ Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy

Plus domains, email, analytics, AI, marketing tools...

We know what credentials each service needs.

---

### Tweet 7 (Feature: Credential Security)
Your API keys deserve better than a .env file.

Nerlude uses:
• AES-256 encryption at rest
• Field-level encryption for secrets
• Environment separation (prod/staging/dev)
• Audit logs for access

Share with team members without exposing raw secrets.

---

### Tweet 8 (Feature: Renewal Alerts)
Never lose a domain again.

Track renewal dates for:
→ Domains
→ SSL certificates
→ Subscriptions
→ API key expirations

Get alerts 30, 14, and 7 days before.

Via email, Slack, or in-app.

---

### Tweet 9 (Feature: Cost Tracking)
Finally answer: "What does this product cost to run?"

• Log costs per service
• Aggregate per project
• Monthly burn across your portfolio
• Spot forgotten services eating your budget

No more surprise bills.

---

### Tweet 10 (Feature: Team Access)
Onboard contractors in minutes.
Offboard them safely.

• Invite to specific projects
• Role-based permissions
• Time-limited access
• Clear audit trail

Know exactly who has access to what.

---

### Tweet 11 (Tech Stack)
Built with modern tools:

• Next.js 16 (App Router)
• React 19
• TypeScript
• Tailwind CSS v4
• Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
• Zustand for state
• Sentry for monitoring

40+ custom components.
Production-ready security.

---

### Tweet 12 (Who It's For)
Built for:

🎯 Portfolio founders running 2-8 products
🎯 Agencies managing client projects
🎯 Startup CTOs scaling their teams

If you juggle multiple services across multiple products, this is for you.

---

### Tweet 13 (What You Get)
What Nerlude gives you:

✅ Peace of mind (nothing expires silently)
✅ Time back (no more credential hunting)
✅ Cost clarity (know your true burn)
✅ Safe collaboration (proper access control)
✅ Documentation (architecture notes with projects)

---

## BONUS THREADS

### Thread 2: "The Real Cost of Running Multiple Products"

**Tweet 1:**
Running multiple products has a hidden tax.

I tracked my time for a month.

Here's what infrastructure management actually costs:

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Time spent per week:

• Managing API keys: 2.5 hours
• Checking dashboards: 1.5 hours
• Updating credentials: 1 hour
• Answering "where is X?" questions: 30 min

That's 5.5 hours/week on infrastructure admin.

**Tweet 3:**
Financial surprises in one year:

• Forgotten Heroku dyno: $84
• Domain I didn't renew: $180 (redemption fee)
• AWS service I thought I deleted: $127
• "Free tier" that wasn't: $340

Total: $731 in preventable costs.

**Tweet 4:**
Mental overhead:

• Constant low-level anxiety about renewals
• Fear of onboarding contractors (credential chaos)
• Guilt about poor documentation
• Stress when something breaks and you can't find the API key

This is the invisible tax.

**Tweet 5:**
I built Nerlude to eliminate this tax.

One place for everything.
Alerts before things expire.
Costs tracked per project.
Credentials secured properly.

The goal: peace of mind.

### Thread 3: "How I Organize 6 Products with 47 Services"

**Tweet 1:**
I run 6 products.

They use 47 different services combined.

Here's how I keep it all organized (and sane):

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The old way:

• Notion page per product (got stale)
• .env files everywhere (insecure)
• Browser bookmarks (chaos)
• Memory (unreliable)

Result: constant anxiety and occasional disasters.

**Tweet 3:**
The new way with Nerlude:

Every service belongs to a project.
Every project has its own dashboard.
Every credential is encrypted.
Every renewal is tracked.

One source of truth.

**Tweet 4:**
My setup:

Project A (SaaS):
→ Vercel + Supabase + Stripe + Cloudflare + Resend

Project B (Mobile):
→ Railway + MongoDB + Apple Developer

Project C (Extension):
→ Netlify + Stripe

All visible in one dashboard.

**Tweet 5:**
The difference:

Before: 47 browser tabs, constant context switching
After: One dashboard, everything organized

Before: "Where's that API key?"
After: Click, copy, done

Before: Surprise bills
After: Cost tracking per project

### Thread 4: "Why Password Managers Don't Work for Developers"

**Tweet 1:**
"Just use 1Password for your API keys"

I tried. Here's why it doesn't work:

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Problem 1: No project context

Password managers organize by site/service.

But I need to know: which Stripe account goes with which product?

Nerlude organizes by project first.

**Tweet 3:**
Problem 2: No cost tracking

I can't see what I'm paying for each service.

I can't aggregate costs per project.

I can't spot forgotten services.

Nerlude tracks costs.

**Tweet 4:**
Problem 3: No renewal alerts

Password managers don't know when your domain expires.

They don't alert you about SSL certificates.

They don't track subscription renewals.

Nerlude does.

**Tweet 5:**
Problem 4: No team access control

I can't give a contractor access to just one project.

I can't set time-limited access.

I can't see who accessed what.

Nerlude handles all of this.

**Tweet 6:**
Password managers are great for passwords.

But developer infrastructure needs something purpose-built.

That's why I built Nerlude.

## SINGLE VIRAL TWEETS (Post Separately)

---

**Tweet A:**
Indie hacker tip:

Create a "services audit" once a quarter.

List every service you pay for.
Check if you still need it.
Verify renewal dates.

I found $340/year in forgotten services last time.

Or just use Nerlude and automate this 😉

---

**Tweet B:**
The scariest moment as a founder:

Getting a Slack message at 2 AM saying your site is down.

Logging in to find your domain expired.

Realizing the renewal email got buried 3 weeks ago.

This is why I built Nerlude.

---

**Tweet C:**
Hot take:

.env files are a terrible way to manage production credentials.

• No encryption
• No access control
• No audit trail
• Easy to commit to git accidentally

We need better tooling for this.

---

**Tweet D:**
Question for founders running multiple products:

How do you track what each product costs to run?

I'm genuinely curious because I couldn't find a good solution.

(This is why I built Nerlude)

---

**Tweet E:**
The contractor onboarding problem:

1. They need access to 5 services
2. You spend 2 hours hunting credentials
3. You share via Slack DM (insecure)
4. Project ends
5. You forget to revoke access

There has to be a better way.

(There is: nerlude.io)
