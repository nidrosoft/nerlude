---

### PROBLEM (10 seconds)
**[Cut to face, frustrated expression]**

"If you're a founder running multiple products, you know this chaos. Every product needs 10-15 different services. Each with its own dashboard, API keys, billing cycle."

---

### PAIN POINT (10 seconds)
**[Show examples on screen]**

"Last month I lost a domain because I forgot to renew it. Cost me $2,400 in lost revenue. And I'm not careless—I just couldn't keep track of everything."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude dashboard]**

"So I built Nerlude. One dashboard for everything that powers your products. All your services, credentials, costs, and renewals—organized by project."

---

### FEATURES (20 seconds)

---

### STORY (20 seconds)
**[Talking to camera]**

"Six months ago I signed up for a 'free tier' to test something. Forgot about it completely. Turns out after the trial, it started charging. $340 later, I finally noticed."

---

### THE INSIGHT (15 seconds)
**[Show services list]**

"Here's the thing—I'm running 6 products with 47 services combined. It's impossible to track everything manually. Something always slips through."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Alarm sound, panicked face]**

"3 AM. My main product is down. Not a bug. The domain expired."

---

### STORY (20 seconds)
**[Storytelling mode]**

"Two years running this product. $4,000 a month in revenue. And I let the domain lapse because the renewal email got buried in my inbox. 72 hours to fix. $2,400 in lost revenue."

---

### THE LESSON (15 seconds)
**[Serious tone]**

"I'm a technical founder. I know how this stuff works. But when you're juggling multiple products, something always falls through the cracks."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude renewal alerts]**

"Now I use Nerlude. It tracks every renewal—domains, SSL certs, subscriptions. Alerts me 30, 14, and 7 days before. Never again."

---

### CTA (5 seconds)
"Don't wait for your 3 AM wake-up call. Link in bio."

---

---

## VIDEO 4: The API Key Hunt
**Duration:** 45-60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Frustrated searching through files]**

"I just spent 2 hours looking for one API key."

---

### PROBLEM (15 seconds)
**[Show the chaos]**

"It was in a .env file. But which one? I have 6 projects. Each has multiple environments. Production, staging, dev. The key could be anywhere."

---

### RELATABLE MOMENT (10 seconds)
**[Face to camera]**

"And this happens every time I onboard a contractor. 'Hey, can you send me the Stripe keys?' And I'm like... give me a few hours."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude credential management]**

"Nerlude fixes this. Every credential organized by project and environment. Encrypted. Click, copy, done. Onboard a contractor in minutes, not hours."

---

### CTA (5 seconds)
"Stop the API key scavenger hunts. Link in bio."

---

---

## VIDEO 5: The Contractor Problem
**Duration:** 45-60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Worried expression]**

"I hired a contractor 6 months ago. He still has access to everything."

---

### PROBLEM (15 seconds)
**[Explaining]**

"When you onboard someone, you share credentials via Slack, email, Notion. The project ends. You forget to revoke access. Now they have your Stripe keys, your database credentials, everything."

---

### THE RISK (10 seconds)
**[Serious tone]**

"This is a massive security risk. And it happens to almost every founder I talk to. We're all guilty of it."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude team access]**

"Nerlude has proper access control. Invite people to specific projects. Set time-limited access. Revoke with one click. See exactly who has access to what."

---

### CTA (5 seconds)
"Secure your credentials properly. Link in bio."

---

---

## VIDEO 6: The "What Does This Cost?" Problem
**Duration:** 45-60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Confused face looking at bills]**

"I have no idea what my SaaS actually costs to run."

---

### PROBLEM (15 seconds)
**[Showing multiple bills]**

"Vercel bill here. Supabase bill there. Stripe fees somewhere else. Domain renewal on a different card. How do I know if this product is actually profitable?"

---

### THE INSIGHT (10 seconds)
**[Talking to camera]**

"Most founders I talk to can't answer this question. We know our revenue. We have no idea about our true infrastructure costs."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude cost tracking dashboard]**

"Nerlude tracks costs per service, per project. You can finally see: 'This product costs $127/month to run.' No more guessing."

---

### CTA (5 seconds)
"Know your real numbers. Link in bio."

---

---

## VIDEO 7: The 40+ Services Demo
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Scrolling through service list]**

"I built a tool that knows about 40+ developer services."

---

### DEMO (40 seconds)
**[Screen recording with voiceover]**

"Nerlude has a service registry. Vercel, Railway, Netlify, AWS—all the hosting platforms. Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, MongoDB—databases. Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy—payments.

And here's the cool part: we know what credentials each service needs. Add Stripe? We show you the fields for publishable key, secret key, webhook secret.

Add Vercel? API token and team ID.

No more guessing what to store."

---

### VALUE PROP (10 seconds)
**[Face to camera]**

"It's like having a pre-built template for every service you use. Just fill in your credentials and you're organized."

---

### CTA (5 seconds)
"Check it out. Link in bio."

---

---

## VIDEO 8: The Security Angle
**Duration:** 45-60 seconds
**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Reels

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Serious face]**

"Your API keys are probably not secure."

---

### PROBLEM (15 seconds)
**[Show examples]**

"Be honest. Where are your production credentials right now?

.env file on your laptop?
Notion page shared with your team?
Slack message from 6 months ago?

None of these are secure."

---

### THE RISK (10 seconds)
**[Explaining]**

"One laptop theft. One compromised Notion account. One Slack data breach. And your entire infrastructure is exposed."

---

### SOLUTION (15 seconds)
**[Show Nerlude security features]**

"Nerlude uses AES-256 encryption. Field-level encryption for sensitive data. Audit logs for access. Row-level security in the database. Your credentials are actually protected."

---

### HOOK (First 3 seconds)
**[Personal, authentic tone]**

### STORY (30 seconds)
**[Talking to camera, genuine]**

"I'm a founder running multiple products. I've lost domains. I've gotten surprise bills. I've spent hours hunting for API keys.

I looked for a tool to solve this. Password managers don't work—no project context. Notion gets stale. Enterprise tools cost $10K a year.

Nothing existed for indie hackers and small teams. So I built it."

---

### WHAT IT IS (15 seconds)

"Nerlude is the tool I wish existed when I started. One place for all your services, credentials, costs, and renewals. Organized by project. Secured properly."
